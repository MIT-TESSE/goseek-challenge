## Additional problem details

### Scenes

The Unity simulator has 5 office-like scenes.

![scenes](images/goseek-scenes.jpg)

Each scene consists of or two hallways with several rooms connected to the the hallway.
Types of rooms include an office, cubical space, a restroom, a break room, and a storage room.

### Target Fruit

The target fruit includes an apple, a banana, a strawberry, an orange, and a cherry.

Fruit are randomly spawned throughout the environment.
However, their distribution is non-uniform.
Fruit are spawned in offices and cubical spaces.
Sometimes they spawn in a hallway just outside of an office.
They don't spawn in other rooms (e.g., restroom, breakroom).

### Semantics

There are 11 semantic categories for objects as follows.
- 0: floor (0,171,143)
- 1: ceiling (1,155,211)
- 2: wall (2,222,110)
- 3: monitor (3,69,227)
- 4: door (4,218,221)
- 5: table (5,81,38)
- 6: chair (6,229,176)
- 7: storage (7,106,60)
- 8: couch (8,179,10)
- 9: clutter (9,118,90)
- 10: target fruit (10,138,80)

The values in parentheses correspond to (red-green-blue) RGB values when semantic segmentation is displayed in videos or directly obtained from the simulator as a 3-channel image (instead of a single channel).
